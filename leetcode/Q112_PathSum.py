# Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
#
# For example:
# Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
#
#               5
#              / \
#             4   8
#            /   / \
#           11  13  4
#          /  \      \
#         7    2      1
#
# return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
