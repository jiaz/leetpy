# Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).
#
# For example:
# Given binary tree {3,9,20,#,#,15,7},
#
#     3
#    / \
#   9  20
#     /  \
#    15   7
#
# return its level order traversal as:
#
# [
#   [3],
#   [9,20],
#   [15,7]
# ]
#
# confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
#
# OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:
#
# The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
#
# Here's an example:
#
#    1
#   / \
#  2   3
#     /
#    4
#     \
#      5
#
# The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}".
