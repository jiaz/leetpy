# Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).
#
# For example, this binary tree is symmetric:
#
#     1
#    / \
#   2   2
#  / \ / \
# 3  4 4  3
#
# But the following is not:
#
#     1
#    / \
#   2   2
#    \   \
#    3    3
#
# Note:
# Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.

#
# OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:
#
# The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
#
# Here's an example:
#
#    1
#   / \
#  2   3
#     /
#    4
#     \
#      5
#
# The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}".
