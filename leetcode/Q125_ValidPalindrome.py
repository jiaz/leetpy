# Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
#
# For example,
# "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
# "race a car" is not a palindrome.
#
# Note:
# Have you consider that the string might be empty? This is a good question to ask during an interview.
#
# For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
