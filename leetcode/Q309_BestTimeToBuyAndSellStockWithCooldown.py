# Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
#
# Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like
# (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:
#
#     You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
#     After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
#
# Example:
#
# prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]
# maxProfit = 3
# transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
#
# Credits:Special thanks to @peisi for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
